/**
 * Page through a Supabase query that can exceed the server's row cap.
 *
 * PostgREST returns at most `db-max-rows` per request — 1000 on Supabase by
 * default — and it does so SILENTLY. There is no error and no flag; you simply
 * get 1000 rows and a truncated view of reality.
 *
 * That has already bitten this app twice:
 *   • Maintenance holds ~1,300 tickets, so the OVERDUE card could never read
 *     above 1000 and the oldest ~300 tickets were invisible. A To-Do deep link
 *     to one of them silently failed, because the id was not in the loaded page.
 *   • store_stock_months holds ~1,791 rows, so the anomaly reconciler was
 *     comparing months it had only partially loaded.
 *
 * Anything that can plausibly grow past a thousand rows — tickets, schedules,
 * monthly stock snapshots, assets — must page. Use a plain query only where the
 * row count is bounded by something real (one factory's users, one file's
 * batches).
 *
 *   const rows = await fetchAllRows<TicketRow>(
 *     (from, to) => supabase.from('maintenance_tickets').select('*').range(from, to),
 *   );
 *
 * The callback is invoked once per page with an inclusive range, exactly as
 * PostgREST expects. Ordering is the caller's job: an unordered paged read can
 * repeat or skip rows between pages, so ALWAYS order by something stable.
