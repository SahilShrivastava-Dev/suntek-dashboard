/**
 * Turning failures into something a person can act on.
 *
 * The app talks to Postgres, PostgREST, Supabase Auth and an edge function, and
 * each reports failure in a different shape — an `Error`, a `{ message, code,
 * details, hint }` object, a `FunctionsHttpError` whose real body is buried in
 * `.context`, or occasionally a bare object with nothing useful in it at all.
 * Toasts were interpolating those straight into the message, which is how a
 * store manager ended up staring at `Login update failed: {}`.
 *
 * Two jobs here:
 *   rawErrorText()  — dig the best available technical string out of ANY shape
 *   humanizeError() — say what actually happened, in plain language
 *
 * The technical detail is never thrown away: it goes to the console, and when
 * nothing is recognisable the user gets a short reference code they can quote
 * to whoever supports them. "Something went wrong" with no way to trace it is
 * as unhelpful as `{}`.
